Installation
************

Setting up the virtualenv (optional)
====================================

First, you should create a virtual environment to seperate python packages
from your system from python packages for teerace. This can be done by
``virtualenv --no-site-packages /directory/for/virtualenv``
After you have created it, activate it. This can be done with
``. venv/bin/activate``
You are now ready to install the required packages. Do that by executing
``pip install -r requirements.txt``

Create a proper settings file
=============================

Note to bnn: Maybe there should be a "development_settings.py.example" file
which alread includes all DEBUG settings set to True?

Setting up the database
=======================

Set the database up like you would setup every django project:
``python manage.py syncdb``. The database will be a sqlite database named
"teerace.sqlite". If you are asked to create a superuser account, SKIP! We will
first need to do a database migration because we are using south:
``python manage.py migrate``

The database is now setup completly and you can create an admin account with
``python manage.py createsuperuser``
